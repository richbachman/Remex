Welcome to Remex.

Remex is a utility class style framework that can be used for rapid prototyping or as a starter stylesheet for a full site build.

Setup is easy. There are three methods:

1. Use the minified CSS directly from GitHub by adding the followin line to the head of your HTML document: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richbachman/Remex/master/dist/css/remex.min.css

2. Download the project, and copy the minified css from the dist folder to your project.

3. Clone the project using git, and make any customizations you see fit.

If you decide to install Remex using option three, all size and color customizations can be made in the appropriate files in the /src/scss/variables directory.

Once customizations have been made, simply run "npm build" to build a new dist file with the minified CSS.

Thank you for taking the time to review this initial Alpha release. Please submit any feedback or feature requests to rb@richbachman.com
